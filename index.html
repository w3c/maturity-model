    <p>The Accessibility Maturity Model provides a framework that equips individuals, and organizations of all sizes, to
      develop, deploy, and maintain, accessibility of both internal and external digital resources over time. This
      comprehensive framework encompasses all aspects of managing an organization's staff resources as well as its
      ever-evolving public ones. It readily scales in support of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Single person consultancies,</li>
      <li>Nonprofits, <abbr title="Non-Governmental Organization">NGO</abbr>s of any size,</li>
      <li>Local and national governmental departments, courts, legislatures, agencies, and commissions,</li>
      <li><abbr title="Small office Home Office">SOHO</abbr> businesses, major international corporate organizations or
        corporate departments, and any business entity type or size.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From public facing content deployment and public facing interactive service provision, to internal activities,
      and
      <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> resources related to employee relations, the W3C Accessibility Maturity
      Model provides a framework for measuring and assessing accessibility maturity, linking staff teams toward common
      goals and objectives. It provides actionable guidance for establishing or improving policies,
      employee-communication, training, and tools. It also includes a way to measure and document organizational,
      cultural and technical, capabilities.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section id="About-maturity-model">
      <h3>About the Accessibility Maturity Model</h3>
      <p>Incorporating considerations for the accessibility of [=Information and Communications Technology=] (ICT)
        Accessibility into an [=organization=]’s workflow and quality governance can be a complex process. While some
        organizations have individuals or departments that support accessibility, many do not. Too often the need for
        systematic governance of accessibility in the organization remains unaddressed. This, in turn, can limit the
        organization's
        ability to produce and sustain accessible products, services, training, and documentation.
      </p>
      The W3C Accessibility Maturity Model (AMM) framework has been developed to address this gap&mdash;to encourage and
      support organizations in establishing and implementing accessibility governance systems within their
      organizations. The AMM exists to assist organizations in systematically integrating ICT accessibility criteria
      into policies, key
      business processes, organizational culture, and management structures, in a consistent, repeatable, and measurable
      fashion.
      </p>
      <p>This Accessibility Maturity Model describes an overall framework for establishing a robust ICT accessibility
        program and identifying areas for improvement. The Accessibility Maturity Model is a tool that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>assesses the current effectiveness and capabilities of an entire organization or subunits within the
          organization</li>
        <li>supports identification of gaps between the current capabilities and the next level of accessibility
          maturity</li>
        <li>supports planning for next steps to improve the organization's accessibility performance over time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Accessibility maturity modeling is very different from accessibility conformance testing</p>

      <p>Conformance testing provides information about the level of accessibility that a particular product conforms
        to, at a particular time. The results of a conformance test provide a picture of a particular version of a
        product, or a
        subcomponent of a product, at the time of testing and evaluation.</p>
      <p>Maturity modeling provides information about the ability of an organization to produce accessible products over
        the long term. The results of a maturity modeling assessment provide a holistic picture of an organization’s
        accessibility initiatives; where the organization is performing accessibility functions well and where
        improvements can be made to remove barriers.</p>

      <h3>Audience for the Accessibility Maturity Model</h3>
      <p>This document is intended to guide and evaluate the levels of organizational accessibility maturity in a public
        or private sector organization at any scale.</p>

      <p>The audience for this maturity model includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Executive levels of an organization’s leadership</li>
        <li>Other levels of management responsible for accessibility maturity</li>
        <li>Policy and business process subject matter experts responsible for putting plans, actions, metrics, and
          governance in place.</li>
      </ul>
      <section id="scope">
        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>This framework encompasses the full scope of an organization's accessibility responsibilities. It brings the
          power of web technologies to the task of identifying those responsibilities and establishing processes to
          measure performance over time.</p>
        <p>This framework may also be used to measure the accessibility maturity level of parts of the organization,
          provided that the limited scope is clearly identified in any reports submitted to third-parties.</p>

      <h3>Research and Standards Review</h3>
      <p>During the development of the W3C Accessibility Maturity Model the Task Force reviewed various existing
        accessibility maturity models. These models differ in scope, structure, and intended audience. Some are
        available at no cost, while others are proprietary and offered at a fee or part of a paid engagement. In
        addition to general-purpose frameworks, some are tailored to specific industries, such as the
        <a href="https://cccaccessibility.org/index.php/acmm/acmm-overview">California Community Colleges Accessibility
          Capability Maturity Model (CCC ACMM) </a> and frameworks developed by
        major technology companies like Microsoft. Three of the most commonly referenced general models are the
        <a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/blog/the-digital-accessibility-maturity-model-introduction-to-damm/">Digital
          Accessibility Maturity Model (DAMM)</a>,<a href="https://www.nascio.org/"> the National Association of State
          Chief Information Officers (NASCIO)</a>
        <a href="https://www.microassist.com/digital-accessibility/pdaa-policy-driven-adoption-for-accessibility/">Policy
          Driven Adoption for Accessibility (PDAA) </a>framework, and <a
          href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:30071:-1:ed-1:v1:en">ISO 30071-1 </a>.
        Organizations embrace diverse accessibility maturity models to benchmark and advance their practices.
      </p>
      <li>The Digital Accessibility Maturity Model (DAMM), developed by Level Access, measures maturity across multiple
        interconnected areas. DAMM encourages collaboration among teams and user-focused testing.</li>
      <li>The NASCIO PDAA Maturity Model can be used as a high level strategic assessment within an organization, and
        also optimized for focusing on digital procurements. PDAA helps agencies incorporate accessibility into
        policies, staff training, and vendor oversight, with tools designed for federal Section 508 compliance that can
        be used more widely.</li>
      <li>ISO 30071 1 evolved from the UK BS 8878 framework. It extends its influence globally by guiding organizations
        in integrating accessibility into ICT development policy, including the development lifecycle, risk control,
        quality assurance, and procurement standards.</li>
      <li>The CCC ACMM addresses California’s community colleges' unique needs by detailing five progressive stages
        across governance, content creation, procurement, and staff development, acknowledging the decentralized nature
        of higher education.</li>

    <h2>Maturity Model Structure</h2>
    <p>The Accessibility Maturity Model is organized around seven essential [=dimensions=] of an [=organization=] where
      accessibility maturity can improve conformance with accessibility standards and regulations.</p>
    <p>Dimensions have a unique descriptive name with a high-level, plain-language summary of what the dimension covers.
      Each dimension has two sub-sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Proof points are criteria for accessibility maturity supported by evidence. Each [=proof point=] includes a
        high-level description. Deliverables are mostly self-explanatory, but in some cases, additional information is
        provided.</li>
      <li>[=Maturity level=], with definitions and expected outcomes to help [=organizations=] assess and report on the
        status of accessibility maturity attained for the dimension. The maturity level indicates what is needed to
        reach full maturity for that dimension.</li>
    </ul>
    <section id="description-dimensions">
      <h3>Dimensions</h3>
      <p>The seven [=dimensions=] of organizational accessibility maturity are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Communications: </strong>Information as it relates to an [=organization=]’s accessibility, as well
          as accessibility of all internal/external communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Culture: </strong>The attitudes, sensitivity, and behaviors around accessibility, including internal
          interaction, perception, and decision-making.</li>
        <li><strong>ICT (Information and Communication Technology) Development Life Cycle: </strong>Incorporation of
          web, software and hardware accessibility considerations in development processes - from idea conception, to
          design, development, testing, [=ACR=] production, user research, maintenance and obsolescence.</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge and Skills: </strong>Ongoing education, and outsourcing practices to fill gaps for
          accessibility operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Personnel: </strong>Job descriptions, recruiting, disability-related employee resource groups
          necessary to provide lived-experience to accessibility efforts.</li>
        <li><strong>Procurement: </strong>A strategic process that concentrates on finding and acquiring accessible
          products required by an organization. Activities may include: sourcing, negotiation, and selecting goods and
          services.</li>
        <li><strong>Support: </strong>Accessibility assistance provided to internal employees and external [=customers=]
          with disabilities.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="description-proof-points">
      <h3>Proof Points</h3>
      <p>Each dimensional outcome has a range of suggested [=proof points=], which includes any evidence or necessary
        measures that can be used to determine the maturity of each [=dimension=]. Progress towards achieving maturity
        is attained by creating the proof points described for each dimension.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proof points are evidence-based, organizational deliverables which indicate the [=maturity level=].</li>
        <li>Proof points are specific to the dimension being focused on. For example, if only procurement maturity is
          being measured, only procurement proof points should be evaluated.</li>
        <li>For some dimensions, proof points are further organized by category.</li>
        <li>Proof points can be partially completed at the Launch and Integrate levels, but must be fully completed for
          the optimize level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, if a dimension requires a plan to identify ICT accessibility related skill levels and gaps, then
        the corresponding proof point would be a document containing the evaluation of ICT accessibility related skill
        levels and gaps.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="description-maturity-stages">
      <h3>Maturity Levels</h3>
      <p>Each level is attained by meeting the defined outcomes for that specific [=dimension=]. The completed [=proof
        points=] demonstrate the efforts to achieve the outcomes for a [=maturity level=].</p>
      <p>All relevant outcomes should be addressed but not all outcomes will apply to all organizations and situations.
        When an outcome does not apply, it is marked N/A (Not applicable). For example, an accessibility policy does not
        need to reference native applications if the organization has none.</p>
      <p>Levels are cumulative, so level advancement is achieved by first meeting the specific criteria of a lower
        level.</p>
      <p>Note: The terms for the levels were adopted for consistency with the <a
          href="https://www.nascio.org/pdaa">Policy-Driven Adoption for Accessibility</a> maturity model, currently
        being used by some U.S. state and local government agencies.</p>

      <p>Levels loosely correspond to the following criteria:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Levels</th>
          <th>Criteria</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Inactive</strong></td>
          <td>Little to no awareness, activity, or recognition, of need.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Launch</strong></td>
          <td>Recognized need in the organization. Planning initiated, but activities not well organized.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Integrate</strong></td>
          <td>Roadmap in place, overall organizational approach defined and well organized.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Optimize</strong></td>
          <td>Incorporated into the whole organization, consistently evaluated, and actions taken on assessment
            outcomes.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Communications</h3>
      <p>Communications need to be accessible to the widest audience possible and meet the requirements in the
        accessibility standards. Accessible communications applies to all communications that are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>external and internal</li>
        <li>formal and informal</li>
        <li>major and minor</li>

        <ol>
          <li>Identify the proof points to be used to assess your organization's [=Dimension=] accessibility maturity.
            Not
            all proof points may apply to every business or organization. The proof points listed here are
            non-exhaustive examples of criteria. They may, or may not apply. You may identify other proof points in
            their place and/or additional proof points.</li>
          <li>List all of the organization&apos;s communication documentation in relation to the identified proof
            points.</li>
          <li>Determine what accessibility maturity level your proof point documentation supports for communication.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The level is <b>Inactive</b> when proof points demonstrate that:</p>

      <h3>ICT Development Lifecycle</h3>
      <p>Accessible Information and communication technologies &#40;ICT&#41; serve as a critical enabler that allows
        persons with disabilities to realize full and effective opportunities to participate, on the basis of equality,
        in all aspects of society and development that involve technology. Accessibility should be considered throughout
        the entire ICT development lifecycle: from idea conception to design, development, testing, production of an
        [=ACR=] based on Industry recognized standards, user research, maintenance, and obsolescence. Training programs

    <h3>Internal resources needed to implement the maturity model at your organization</h3>
    <p> Implementing the maturity model is a group effort. We know that every organization is set up differently and will
      have different titles/roles, so we compiled a sample list to help you get started and identify who will be helping
      you on the proof points and the dimensions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You should identify a key leader that&#8217;s responsible for key aspects of each dimension and for driving
        that dimension to full maturity. The leader may or may not have knowledge of digital accessibility.</li>
      <li>If accessibility is new to the dimension leader(s), they should gain basic digital accessibility training. We
        suggest checking out <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/foundations-course/">W3C&#8217;s free, online
          courses</a> to learn more about what digital accessibility is, why it&#8217;s important, and who benefits from
        it.</li>
      <li>If your organization has the ability to form a working group, that might be a great way to collaborate on this
        effort.</li>
