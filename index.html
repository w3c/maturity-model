        Digital accessibility is a human right. Yet 1.3 billion people in the world living with disability experience accessibility barriers everyday. The cost of excluding people with disabilities is high. Not only from a civil rights standpoint but also from a business perspective. People with disabilities represent the largest minority worldwide with a discretionary income in the billions. Companies risk losing customers, revenue and top talent while also facing legal risk, as digital accessibility is required by law in many countries.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The W3C develops and provides free digital accessibility protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the digital world and equal access for all. These protocols and guidelines are considered to be the gold standard for digital accessibility around the world.
      </p>
        Whether your company is just starting its cultural transformation on disability inclusion or looking to improve existing processes, the W3C Accessibility Maturity Model can help. It provides a framework for measuring and assessing accessibility maturity, linking teams toward common goals and objectives.
      <p>
        The model is designed to work for any size organization. From small consultancies and large enterprises, to nonprofit/NGOs and government agencies, it provides actionable guides for establishing or improving policies, employee-communication, training, and tools. It also includes a way to measure and document organizational, cultural and technical capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The W3C Accessibility Maturity Model is intended to be independent of the requirements in relevant technical accessibility standards, such as WAI-ARIA and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital accessibility is a journey. Humans have a wide range of needs and preferences when it comes to using digital products, so there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all solution. This can make it challenging to address every individual requirement. However, with a solid maturity model organizations can make significant progress towards improving accessibility and creating inclusive experiences for as many people as possible, meeting your consumers and employees where they&#8217;re at.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="About-maturity-model">
        <h3>About the W3C Accessibility Maturity Model</h3>
        <p>Incorporating considerations for the accessibility of [=Information and Communications Technology=] (ICT) Accessibility into an [=organization=]’s workflow and quality governance can be a complex process. While some organizations have individuals or departments that support accessibility, many do not recognize the importance of ICT accessibility as a requirement, or the need for accessibility governance systems. This can limit their ability to produce accessible products and services, including training and documentation, which are essential for inclusive digital environments.</p>
        <p>This challenge can be solved by encouraging organizations to establish and implement accessibility governance systems within their organizations. These systems integrate ICT accessibility criteria into policies, key business processes, organizational culture, and management structures in a consistent, repeatable, and measurable fashion. Only then can organizations address the complexities related to enabling ICT accessibility.</p>
        <p>This proposed W3C Accessibility Maturity Model describes an overall framework for establishing a robust ICT accessibility program and identifying areas for improvement. The W3C Accessibility Maturity Model is a tool that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assesses the current effectiveness and capabilities of  an entire organization or subunits within the organization</li>
          <li>supports identification of gaps between the current capabilities and the next level of accessibility maturity</li>
          <li>supports plans for next steps to improve the organization's accessibility performance over time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Organizations know when they are doing well (or poorly) with product accessibility using audit reports and bug counts. However, these metrics don’t indicate how the organization is doing operationally to continue to produce accessible products without examining some key corporate processes. The W3C Accessibility ​Maturity Model is a big part of a “shift-left” methodology of preventing problems from recurring, not fixing them after they have happened.</p>

        <p>​Most maturity models contain a number of levels with increasing levels of maturity. Each level contains a definition, controls, a list of processes, and [=proof points=] that can be produced for an organization to legitimately claim that they are at a particular level of maturity.</p>

        <p>Accessibility maturity modeling is very different than accessibility conformance testing</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conformance testing provides information about the level of accessibility conformance of a particular product. The results of a conformance test provide a picture of a particular version of a product (or a subcomponent of a product).</li>
          <li>Maturity modeling provides information about the ability of an organization to produce accessible products over the long term. The results of a maturity modeling assessment provide a holistic picture of an organization’s accessibility initiatives; where the organization is doing accessibility well and where improvements can be made to remove barriers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Audience for the W3C Accessibility Maturity Model</h3>
        <p>This document is intended to guide and evaluate the levels of organizational accessibility maturity that encompasses a public or private sector organization at any scale.</p>
        <p>The primary audience for this maturity model is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Executive levels of an organization’s leadership</li>
          <li>Other levels of management responsible for particular aspects of the maturity of the defined dimensions</li>
          <li>Policy and business process subject matter experts responsible for putting plans, actions, metrics, and governance in place</li>
        </ul>
        <section id="scope">
          <h4>Scope</h4>
          <p>This document may also be used to measure the maturity level of parts of the organization, provided that the limited scope is clearly identified in any reports submitted to third-parties.</p>

      <section id="existing-research">
        <h3>Existing Research and Standards</h3>
        <p>The W3C maturity model has been developed using research of existing maturity models and standards outside of WCAG. For example, </p>
          <ul>
            <li>ISO/IEC 30071-1:2019 Information Technology - Development Of User Interface Accessibility - Part 1: Code Of Practice For Creating Accessible ICT Products And Services <p>This ISO standard includes specifics to the incorporation of accessibility practices into the design and development process. This is orthogonal to the W3C Accessibility Maturity Model which provides a way to assess an organization's accessibility maturity in dimensions beyond the design and development process. Adherence to ISO 30071-1:2019 could be used as a [=proof point=] for the maturity of the ICT Development Lifecycle dimension.</p></li>
          </ul>
        <p class="ednote">We intend to add other models the group has researched to this list.</p>

      <h2>Maturity Model Structure</h2>
      <p>The W3C Accessibility Maturity Model is organized around seven important aspects, or [=dimensions=], of an [=organization=] where accessibility maturity can improve conformance with accessibility standards and regulations.</p> 
      <p>Dimensions have a unique descriptive name with a high-level, plain-language summary of what the dimension covers. Each dimension has two sub-sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proof points, or tangible evidence, that can be used to demonstrate progress. Each [=proof point=] includes a high-level description. Deliverables are mostly self-explanatory, but in some cases, additional information is provided.</li>
        <li>[=Maturity stages=], with definitions and expected outcomes to help [=organizations=] assess and report on the level of accessibility maturity attained for the dimension. The maturity stages indicate what is needed to reach full maturity for that dimension.</li>
      </ul>
      <section id="description-dimensions">
        <h3>Dimensions</h3>
        <p>The seven [=dimensions=] of organizational accessibility maturity are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Communications: </strong>Information as it relates to an [=organization=]’s accessibility, as well as accessibility of all internal/external communications.</li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge and Skills: </strong>Ongoing education, and outsourcing practices to fill gaps for accessibility operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Support: </strong>Accessibility assistance provided to internal employees and external [=customers=] with disabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>ICT (Information and Communication Technology) Development Life Cycle: </strong>Incorporation of web, software and hardware accessibility considerations in development processes - from idea conception, to design, development, testing, ACR production, user research, maintenance and obsolescence.</li>
          <li><strong>Personnel: </strong>Job descriptions, recruiting, disability-related employee resource groups necessary to provide lived-experience to accessibility efforts.</li>
          <li><strong>Procurement: </strong>A strategic process that concentrates on finding and acquiring accessible products required by an organization. Activities may include: sourcing, negotiation, and selecting goods and services.</li>
          <li><strong>Culture: </strong>The attitudes, sensitivity, and behaviors around accessibility, including internal interaction, perception, and decision-making.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="description-proof-points">
        <h3>Proof Points</h3>
        <p>Each dimensional outcome has a range of suggested [=proof points=], which includes any evidence or necessary measures that can be used to determine the maturity of each [=dimension=]. Progress towards achieving maturity is attained by creating the proof points described for each dimension.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Proof points are evidence-based, organizational deliverables which indicate the [=maturity stage=].</li>
          <li>Proof points are specific to the dimension being focused on.  For example, if only procurement maturity is being measured, only procurement proof points should be evaluated.</li>
          <li>For some dimensions, proof points are further organized by category.</li>
          <li>Proof points can be partially completed at the Launch and Integrate stages, but must be fully completed for the optimize stage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if a dimension requires a plan to identify ICT accessibility related skill levels and gaps, then the corresponding proof point would be a document containing the evaluation of ICT accessibility related skill levels and gaps.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="description-maturity-stages">
          <h3>Maturity Stages</h3>
          <p>Each stage is attained by meeting the defined outcomes for that specific [=dimension=]. The completed [=proof points=] demonstrate the efforts to achieve the outcomes for a [=maturity stage=].</p>
          <p>All relevant outcomes should be addressed but not all outcomes will apply to all organizations and situations. When an outcome does not apply, it is marked N/A (Not applicable). For example, an accessibility policy does not need to reference native applications if the organization has none.</p>
          <p>Stages are cumulative, so stage advancement is achieved by first meeting the specific criteria of a lower level.</p>
          <p>Note: The terms for the stages were adopted for consistency with the <a href="https://www.nascio.org/pdaa">Policy-Driven Adoption for Accessibility</a> maturity model, currently being used by some U.S. state and local government agencies.</p>
            
          <p>Stages loosely correspond to the following criteria:</p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Stages</th>
              <th>Criteria</th>

        <h3>Assessment Template</h3>
        <p>Organizational ICT Accessibility Maturity is assessed using the W3C Accessibility Maturity Model assessment template. The template contains worksheet tabs specific to each [=dimension=]. The dimension tabs are organized with the dimension definitions and outcomes for each of the four [=maturity stages=] and provides a list of the dimension’s [=proof points=].</p>
        <p>The blank cells below each maturity stage are to be completed by the [=organization=] and provide space to document evidence that the organization has reached that stage. The evidence can include progress on [=proof point=] completion, or other relevant information that can be used to claim that the outcomes for that stage have been met.</p>
        <p>Proof points can span across multiple stages, work being initiated in one stage and completed in a more advanced stage.</p>

        <p> Implementing the maturity model is a group effort. We know that every company is set up differently and will have different titles/roles, so we compiled a sample list to help you get started and identify who will be helping you on the proof points and the dimensions.

        <ul>
          <li>You should identify a key leader that&#8217;s responsible for key aspects of each dimension and for driving that dimension to full maturity. The leader may or may not have knowledge of digital accessibility.</li>
          <li>If accessibility is new to the dimension leader(s), they should gain basic digital accessibility training. We suggest checking out <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/foundations-course/">W3C&#8217;s free, online courses</a> to learn more about what digital accessibility is, why it&#8217;s important, and who benefits from it.</li>
