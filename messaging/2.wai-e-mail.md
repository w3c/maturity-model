Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI invites you to comment on a wide review draft preparatory to the publication of a version 1.0 APA Group Note:
Accessibility Maturity Model

Comments are due by 23:59 (Midnight) Boston Time Tuesday 30 September 2025.
> 
Overview:

The Accessibility Maturity Model (AMM) describes an overall framework
for establishing a robust ICT accessibility program and identifying
areas for improvement. The Accessibility Maturity Model is a tool that:

-   Assesses the current effectiveness and capabilities of an entire
    organization or subunits within the organization

-   Supports identification of gaps between the current capabilities and
    the next level of accessibility maturity

-   Supports plans for next steps to improve the organization\'s
    accessibility performance over time

-   The approaches identified in this document are intended to influence organizational programs and advance accessibility focus from making digital assets and services accessible to creating an environment in which organizational maturity, specific to digital accessibility, may be measured and evaluated over time. This evolution towards proactive accessibility is relevant to all parts of an organization that contribute directly or indirectly to influencing digital accessibility maturity.

Seeking input:

We continue to encourage broad review from a cross-disability
perspective. This wide review draft note incorporates substantial revisions made in
response to various stakeholders\' comments on previous Working
Drafts. Previous comments led to additional details and definitions
as well as clarification of the document\'s scope.
