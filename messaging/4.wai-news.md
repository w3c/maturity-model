For Wide Review: APA Group Note Accessibility Maturity Model 1.0

**Date:**Â 20 November 2024

The Accessible Platform Architectures
([APA](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/)) Maturity Model Task Force
([MMTF](https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/maturity/)) welcomes feedback on
a wide review draft preparatory to publication of a 1.0 version 
of the W3C Group Note: W3CAccessibility Maturity Model. 

Comments are due by 23:59 (Midnight) Boston Time Tuesday 30 September 2025.

The Accessibility Maturity Model (AMM) describes an overall framework for 
establishing a robust ICT accessibility program and identifying areas for 
improvement. The Accessibility Maturity Model is a tool that:

-   Assesses the current effectiveness and capabilities of an entire
    organization or subunits within the organization

-   Supports identification of gaps between the current capabilities and
    the next level of accessibility maturity

-   Supports plans for next steps to improve the organization\'s
    accessibility performance over time

-   The approaches identified in this note are intended to influence organizational programs and advance accessibility focus from making digital assets and services       accessible to creating an environment in which organizational maturity, specific to digital accessibility, may be measured and evaluated over time. This evolution     towards proactive accessibility is relevant to all parts of an organization that contribute directly or indirectly to influencing digital accessibility maturity.

The MMTF will continue to develop and refine this note.

implementing the model.
